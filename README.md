#  How to use this file

We ask that all students working on their Bachelor or Master projects/theses have to hand in the source code and project documentation. Source code (including architecture and comments) has to adhere to our [developer guidelines](https://isgroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/STUD/pages/1409184/Developer+Guidelines). The project documentation has to consist of a `README.md` file (optionally also more `.md` files if useful) that contains the following information. Thus, copy this file's content as a template in your project and revise it with your project's information.

Besides using the following template, also check out the following sources to see some examples or read further useful information on how to write a good `README.md` for your project. Note that the exemplary projects do not 100% follow this template (either because they are created by third-parties or were created before we consolidated all the information into this template) but are still examples of good `README.md` files.

# AnnoMathTeX

AnnoMathTeX - a LaTeX text and formula annotation recommendation tool for STEM documents

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists and which issue it addresses.
 
## Features

What makes your project stand out? Include logo/demo screenshot etc.

## Components/Modules/Workflow

Visualize an overview of the different components/modules of the system as well as the workflow and describe the individual parts

## Very Short Code Examples

Show what the library does as **concisely** as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise. See the [news-please project](https://github.com/fhamborg/news-please/blob/master/README.md#use-within-your-own-code-as-a-library) for example.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## How to use? (maybe optional)

If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to using your project. Whether this section is required and if it should be part of the `README.md` depends on your project. If the `Very Short Code Examples` from above already comprehensively (despite being concise!) cover all the major functionality provided by your project, the `How to use?` section can be omitted. However, if you think that users/developers of your project will need more information to fully understand how to use your project, the section `How to use?` is mandatory. Next, you need to decide where to put this information. If it is just a few information, you may add it to the `README.md`, if not, place the information into a new `.md` file.

## Results

If you are about to complete your project, include your preliminary results that you also show in your final project presentation, e.g., precision/recall/F1 measure and/or figures highlighting what your project does with input data. If applicable, at first briefly describe the dataset your created/use and the use cases.

If you are about to complete your thesis, just include the most important findings (precision/recall/F1 measure) and refer the to the corresponding pages in your thesis document.
